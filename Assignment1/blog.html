    <h2>Entry 1: Beginning HTML and github [9/30/18]</h2>
    <p>
      This was a pretty straight forward assignment for me since I have
      already coded in HTML before and I have used git and github. However, it was good
      to get back into it and make sure I still know what I am doing. It has been awhile
      since I have used HTML so it was good to refresh myself. I did look up how to change
      the size of a picture because mine was way too big.
